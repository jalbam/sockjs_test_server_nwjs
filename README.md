Description

Just a simple SockJS server running on Node.js but using NW.js (formely node-webkit) to provide a simple visual interface for testing purposes.

It comes with a self-extracting single-file binary for Windows 32-bit (using 7zip's SFX) that runs on Windows XP and higher (generated with Web2Executable) but also includes the source code so it can be ported to other platforms supported by NW.js easily.
